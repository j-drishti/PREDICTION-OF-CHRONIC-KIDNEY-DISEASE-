# PREDICTION-OF-CHRONIC-KIDNEY-DISEASE-

In this paper, we present machine learning techniques for predicting chronic kidney disease using clinical data. Various machine learning methods are explored including logistic regression, Naive bayes classifier, K-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier, support vector machines (SVM) with various kernels such as linear, polynomial and rbf (radial basis function), Random Forest classifier, decision tree classifiers, Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, and Neural Networks.
For improving these learning techniques various cross validation methods are used. Different evaluation metrics such as accuracy score, confusion matrix, precision, recall, f1-score, AUC, ROC are being used to compare their performance.
